<p class="title">Your Horoscope for the Week</p>
  <p class="time">Jul 3, 2017 - Jul 9, 2017</p>
<p class="sign">Pisces</p>
<p class="horoscope">Someone in your social circle could be jealous of you and show it over coming days. Try not to take this personally, 
as a lack of confidence may be causing the person to act that way. If you can talk it out, you may discover the deeper reason and help 
resolve the matter. Meanwhile, a lovely aspect could encourage you to do more entertaining and enjoy having guests over. A party on July
8 could be pretty boisterous.</p>
