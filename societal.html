<h2>Facts</h2>
<p>Did you know that almost 3/4 of Americans have been a victim of cyber crime? It is important to never reveal confidential information
on the Internet. This includes but is not excluded to your address, social security number, and credit card number. You should also never
use easy to guess passwords or the same password for everything. These practices can make you an easy victim of cyber crime.</p>
<h2>Feelings</h2>
<p>I think that many of us do not use safe Internet practices. Most people tend to use the same password over and over, while others 
reveal sensitive information. I think that we ALL need to be more cautious. Something minor could have MAJOR consequences!
