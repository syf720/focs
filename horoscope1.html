<p class="title">Your Horoscope for the Week</p>
  <p class="time">Jul 3, 2017 - Jul 9, 2017</p>
<p class="sign">Cancer</p>
<p class="horoscope">It’s possible that you and another may not see eye to eye. If so, the coming week encourages you to take gentle 
steps to resolve the situation. Tension could continue in the background over the coming days, so find a way to handle it positively. 
It will give you the confidence to finally resolve the situation. The Full Moon on July 8 could bring feelings to the surface, even 
those you’d hoped to keep secret. This can be both a relief and a release.</p>
